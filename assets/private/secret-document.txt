WEBAUTHN SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
========================================

This document contains sensitive information about the WebAuthn implementation
and should only be accessible to authenticated users.

SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE:
-------------------

1. Authentication Flow:
   - User registers with invite code + WebAuthn credential
   - Credentials stored encrypted in PostgreSQL
   - Sessions managed server-side with tower-sessions
   - Private content protected by authentication middleware

2. Database Schema:
   - invite_codes: Single-use registration tokens
   - users: User accounts linked to invite codes
   - webauthn_credentials: FIDO2 credential storage
   - tower_sessions: Secure session management

3. Security Measures:
   - Invite code validation prevents unauthorized registration
   - WebAuthn eliminates password-based attacks
   - Middleware enforces authentication for private routes
   - All sensitive operations logged and audited

PRIVATE API ENDPOINTS:
---------------------

The following endpoints require authentication:

/private/*          - Static file serving (this document)
/api/user/profile   - User profile management (future)
/api/admin/*        - Administrative functions (future)
/api/secure/*       - Secure data access (future)

CREDENTIAL MANAGEMENT:
---------------------

WebAuthn credentials are stored using the webauthn-rs library with:
- Public key cryptography for authentication
- Counter-based replay protection
- Secure credential serialization to database
- Support for multiple authenticators per user

INVITE CODE SYSTEM:
------------------

Security features of the invite code system:
- Cryptographically random 8-character codes
- Single-use enforcement at database level
- Audit trail of code usage and user association
- Admin-only generation via CLI tool

MIDDLEWARE IMPLEMENTATION:
-------------------------

The authentication middleware:
1. Extracts session from request
2. Validates session against database
3. Allows/denies access based on authentication status
4. Logs all access attempts for security monitoring

THREAT MODEL:
------------

Protections against common attacks:
- Phishing: WebAuthn prevents credential theft
- Password attacks: No passwords used in system
- Session hijacking: Secure session management
- Unauthorized registration: Invite code requirement
- Replay attacks: WebAuthn counter mechanism

This document demonstrates that only authenticated users can access
private static content in the WebAuthn demo system.

If you can read this, your WebAuthn authentication was successful!
The middleware properly validated your session and granted access to this
restricted content.
