# Thread: June 19, 2025 - Monorepo Workspace Restructuring and Dependency Management

### (Initial Monorepo Request)

"ohey again! so we were in the middle of remodeling the source files into different dirs in a monorepo workspace style. one package will be for the cli and another package for the server.

please try to avoid traversing up the filesystem tree to any parent folders to `axum_tutorial`"

### (WebAuthn-RS Dependency Fix)

"oh wait! i know what's up here, i started with a demo example from the `webauthn-rs` source repo. what i want to do is get `webauthn-rs` from crates.io not a local file path!"

### (Continuation Request)

"oops, can you pick up where you left off?"

### (Documentation Request)

"can you write all the prompts i've given in this thread to a new section (starting at the beginning of the file, not the end) in the docs/prompts.md file? heads up! i might be working in a different directory now. please don't worry about looking at any other files than docs/promps.md."

# Thread: June 24, 2025 - Request Analytics with PostgreSQL Integration

**Prompt:** "ohey, so i was working with the v4 claude sonnet but hit rate limits before it completed. i'm picking back up again with you. we were trying to get this new request logger analytics things going. can you help me get it working? it seems to be close but missing some things to enable actually logging data to my pg db."

**Context:** User needed help completing a partially implemented request analytics logger that would store data in PostgreSQL.

**Prompt:** "oops, heads up! i'm working in a different directory now!"

**Context:** User informed that they're now working in a different directory structure.

**Prompt:** "hey, yeah, so don't worry about looking at any files other than docs/prompts.md. i just want you to take all the promps i've typed out in this thread and write them to docs/prompts.md (at the top of the file, not the end)."

**Context:** User clarified they only wanted the prompts from this thread added to the documentation file.

# Thread: June 19, 2025 - Analytics System Implementation

This thread covers the implementation of a comprehensive analytics system for the WebAuthn authentication server.

### (Initial Request)

**Prompt:** "ohey! so this is a basic web authn demo, currently anyone can register. i'd like to make it so that only people who have an invite code can register. i'd like a cli util to generate short random invite codes. and i'd also like to use sqlx to save these codes. i'd also like the session and webauthn storage to all use the same pg database."

**Context:** User wanted to add invite code functionality with PostgreSQL storage and CLI management tools.

### (Error Debugging Request)

**Prompt:** "i seem to be getting this error trying to generate a new invite with the cli: CLI error: error with configuration: relative URL without a base"

**Context:** User encountered an error when trying to generate invite codes with the CLI tool.

### (Rate Limit Recovery)

**Prompt:** "oops, can you try again and pickup where you left off?"

**Context:** User asked to continue after hitting a rate limit during the implementation.

### (Analytics Implementation Request)

**Prompt:** "brilliant! okay, now what about some analytics? can we start with logging all the http requests to a new pg database table? is there perhaps an easy way to use open telemetry standards? if too complex, starting with a few database fields like datetime stamps, some kind of key, user id, and then just a big json blob of data?"

**Context:** User requested analytics implementation with PostgreSQL logging and asked about OpenTelemetry integration.

### (500 Error Debugging)

**Prompt:** "ohey again, stuck here, the code builds but requests that should log analytics seem broken and give a 500 error from the server and return `Can't extract session. Is SessionManagerLayer enabled?`. can you add some debugging so i can debug and trace back to the source of the problem?"

**Context:** User encountered 500 errors with session extraction in the analytics middleware and requested debugging help.

### (Continuation After Rate Limit)

**Prompt:** "oops, getting rate limited, can you pick up where you left off and try again?"

**Context:** User asked to continue after another rate limit interruption.

### (Rate Limit Recovery Again)

**Prompt:** "oops, again, stopped early because of rate limit ;( can you try again?"

**Context:** Another rate limit recovery request.

### (Continuation Request)

**Prompt:** "oops, getting close but stopped early because of rate limit ;( can you try again?"

**Context:** User asked to continue the implementation that was interrupted by rate limits.

### (System Status Check)

**Prompt:** "okay, cool! this seems to be working now. what else? can you start cleaning up the dead code?"

**Context:** User confirmed the analytics system was working and requested code cleanup.

### (Documentation Request)

**Prompt:** "can you write all the prompts i've given in this thread to a new section (starting at the beginning of the file, not the end) in the docs/prompts.md file?"

**Context:** User requested documentation of all prompts from the current conversation thread.

# Previous Conversations

## conversation that got too big to continue using :/

can you make it so that configuration comes from a .jsonc file instead of an .env file? i'll need some env stuff for docker and sqlx i suppose, so maybe there could be a cli command to generate a .env file from the .jsonc file for the stuff that needs env vars? i'll add more configuration and feature flag stuff later. what sort of options are there for typeing and editor support for helping the user set correct config? is .jsonc the best option? i'd want to config file that supports comments, maybe .toml is better? i picked jsonc because i will also, in the future, want to dispense this config out from an api route. at the very least, could the app check the make sure the config is valid on startup and if not, try to help the user understand what's wrong?

cool cool!! so a couple of things, so i guess keeping secrets out of the config makes some sense, but i'd like to keep things like DATABASE_PASSWORD and such in a config file, maybe a seperate config.secrets.jsonc file? or maybe you have a better suggestion?

a couple other things to fix in the code, please: can you make config.example.json a jsonc file instead and do include all the inline comments about what each config does.

amazing! so two things: can you setup an example secrets file i can check into source control? also, can you make it so that .env file does not have comments?

okay, now can you remove the config and feature variations for wasm and javascript? i'd like the application to simply use both and not have either-or options. the wasm stuff doesn't need it's own dir in assets or a special route, it can just be like wasm.html for example.

can you take a stab and fixing all the warnings?

can we try to remove the memory storage stuff and instead use the pg db? might need some new tables and migrations. also maybe keeping the memory stuff around, or configurable, would be useful for testing and perhaps for quickstart demos? so yeah, option to use either memory or a real pg db. could the other stuff that uses pg also get configured to use in-memory option?

# Conversation Prompts Log

This document contains all the prompts from conversations about building the WebAuthn authentication server.

**Note:** Timestamps are not available for most prompts as the AI doesn't have access to exact message timing metadata. Only the most recent prompt includes an actual timestamp.

## Thread: Storage.rs Refactoring and Async Trait Elimination

### (Storage.rs Focus Request)

**Prompt:** "can you focus on this src/storage.rs file? the async_trait stuff is giving me grief. do we really need that? or can you figure out how to fix that file and make sure it passes `rustc src/storage.rs`? don't edit other files please."

**Context:** User was experiencing issues with async_trait in the storage.rs file and wanted it fixed to compile with rustc directly.

### (Continuation Request)

**Prompt:** "oops, can you try to continue?"

**Context:** User asked to continue working on fixing the remaining errors in the project after initial storage.rs work.

### (Workspace Structure Request)

**Prompt:** "...okay, so actually, what i'd prefer here is a workspace setup. where the cli.rs is in it's own `cli/` folder. and the main.rs related modules are in a `server/` folder. can we start doing that instead of thrashing on the use crate:: stuff? you will probably need to fix that after remodeling the files into a monorepo workspace style..."

**Context:** User wanted to restructure the project into a proper workspace with separate crates for CLI and server components instead of dealing with import issues.

### (Preference for crate:: imports)

**Prompt:** "oops! can you please do `use create::` style and not `use axum_tutorial::` please?

do i need to update the edition in my cargo.toml? i think we need to first focus on getting the new storage.rs file compiling. maybe the import errors are a red herring? are the storage_standalone.rs and storage_test.rs files needed?"

**Context:** User preferred crate:: style imports and questioned whether test files were needed, wanting to focus on getting storage.rs working properly.

### (Documentation Request for Current Thread)

**Prompt:** "can you write all the prompts i've given in this thread to a new section (starting at the beginning of the file, not the end) in the docs/prompts.md file?"

**Context:** User requested documentation of the current thread's prompts to be added to the beginning of the prompts.md file.

## Thread: June 19, 2025 - Code Modularization and Role-Based Access Control

### (Initial Setup and Format-on-Save Issue)

**Prompt:** "hmm, still don't seem to be getting a format on save, tho"

**Context:** User was having issues with format-on-save functionality in their editor (Zed) with dprint configuration.

### (SQL Migration Request)

**Prompt:** "okay great! thank you! so, next, i'd like to yank all of the inlined r# sql in database.rs and move it into .sql files in the migrations/ dir. there's some existing migrations there, i will completly reset my pg data so please don't worry about building migrations based on my current database-- please add .sql files in the migrations/ directory in a clean and tidy fashion."

**Context:** User wanted to extract inline SQL from database.rs into proper migration files.

### (Clarification on SQL Organization)

**Prompt:** "actually, i don't really need dprint to rust .rs files, i mostly just want it to handle the .jsonc files, can you remove the rust formatting stuff with dprint config? but i still want to get to the bottom of why format on save for jsonc files isn't working"

**Context:** User clarified they only wanted dprint to format .jsonc files, not Rust files.

### (Migration Approach Clarification)

**Prompt:** "...well, actually i don't want to queries in the migrations folder, lolol, can you put them back into the database.rs file? i just want the `CREATE` and any schema related stuff in the migrations/ dir"

**Context:** User clarified they only wanted schema-related SQL in migrations, not application queries.

### (Idempotent Migrations Request)

**Prompt:** "okay great, ty. can you make the sql files in the migrations/ folder idempotent? like so they can be run repeadly without error, so like `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXIST`"

**Context:** User wanted migration files to be safe to run multiple times.

### (Migration Error Explanation)

**Prompt:** "can you explain this: % sqlx migrate run error: migration 1 was previously applied but has been modified"

**Context:** User encountered an sqlx migration integrity error.

### (Format-on-Save Issue with Specific File)

**Prompt:** "...oh, so i guess dprint formatter isn't, for some reason, formatting on save my config.secrets.jsonc file? is this because it's .gitignore'd?"

**Context:** User noticed format-on-save wasn't working for a specific .gitignored file.

### (Code Modularization Request)

**Prompt:** "okay, just splendid, curious if there might be a way to further modularize the code in server/src/? i'd like for all this auth and middleware analytics stuff (but not the static file serving stuff) to feel like it has a clean place to live on it's own. i'll continue to add more api routes and database stuff. don't yet edit any files, just give me some high-level thoughts about how you'd think it's best to go about this"

**Context:** User wanted advice on modularizing the codebase for better organization.

### (Database Modularization Question)

**Prompt:** "ah yes, i think i'm more into option 1 as well. okay, one more question before editing anything. any thoughts about how to break apart the large database.rs file? would it make sense to split the db related stuff into each module? like the auth/db.rs and analytics/db.rs or something along those lines?"

**Context:** User agreed with Option 1 (feature-based modules) and asked about database code organization.

### (Cross-Domain Complexity Question)

**Prompt:** "hmm, i think i'm into the hybrid option c, but i have more questions. i think i'd like to avoid one huge database/models.rs file. i'd think the the models could sit inside each module? like the auth stuff is in the auth/ dir and so on. but am i maybe missing some complexities with this approach? the point about cross-domain queries and when the data ia mixed together seems right on but i'm, at the point, not quite seeing it clearly. can you elaborate more on the tradeoffs i'd be making here with this approach? say i end up needing to join different modules data together, walk me thru what that'd look like as example"

**Context:** User wanted to understand the complexities of domain-specific models and cross-domain queries.

### (Implementation Go-Ahead)

**Prompt:** "right, i like the idea of composition here with more modules that would mix different modules together. right, okay, so i guess let it rip with remodeling the source code files, please :)"

**Context:** User approved the modular approach and requested implementation.

### (Legacy Cleanup Request)

**Prompt:** "hey, this seems to be going well enough, but i don't think i understand the legacy namespace? i'm pretty sure i don't need backwards compatability right now. can you remove all that? also, if there's a name of a module or whatever that's the same as a crate dependency or whatever outside dependency, i'm fine with changing the names of things in my code to something that isn't already being used (so avoid `as` imports)."

**Context:** User wanted to remove legacy compatibility code and avoid naming conflicts.

### (User Roles Implementation Request)

**Prompt:** "okay, amazing! alright, so can you work in the code needed to support user roles? i'd like two: admin and user (tho is there perhaps a better name than "user")? i'd like some routes to be admin only (like maybe the analytics stuff) but otherwise the static file routes are for any auth'd user."

**Context:** User requested implementation of a role-based access control system with admin and regular user roles.

### (Documentation Request)

**Prompt:** "cool! ty. can you dump all helpful text you just gave me after "Here's what we've implemented:" into docs/roles.md file?"

**Context:** User wanted the role implementation summary documented.

### (Prompts Documentation Request)

**Prompt:** "swank! okay, how about this: are you able to recall all of the prompts i've given you in the last day (so all of them, not just the ones in this thread)? if so, can you write them all to docs/prompts.md?"

**Context:** User requested documentation of all prompts from our conversation.

### (Documentation Formatting Request)

**Prompt:** "thanks! can you format it such that this thread is a section? and instead of incrementing numbers can you write the date time stamp of the prompt?"

**Context:** User requested better formatting for the prompts documentation with timestamps instead of numbers.

### 2025-06-19T22:15:13.351573-04:00 (Timestamp Clarification Request)

**Prompt:** "hmm, curious, i don't understand the `2024-12-18` date 🤔 what i mean is: can you write the date & time that i wrote the prompt? (please also include this prompt)"

**Context:** User clarified they wanted actual timestamps of when prompts were written, not placeholder dates. They also requested this prompt be included in the documentation.

## Summary

This thread covered a comprehensive development session that included:

1. **Development Environment Setup** - Fixing format-on-save with dprint and Zed
2. **Database Migration Strategy** - Moving from inline SQL to migration files, making them idempotent
3. **Code Architecture** - Modularizing the codebase into domain-specific modules using repository pattern
4. **Role-Based Access Control** - Implementing admin/member user roles with middleware protection
5. **Documentation** - Creating comprehensive docs for implemented features and conversation history

The conversation demonstrates a progression from tooling issues through architectural decisions to feature implementation, with the user consistently seeking clean, maintainable solutions while avoiding legacy compatibility overhead.

# Thread: June 20, 2025 - Config Migration, Recovery Codes, UI Redesign & Host/Port Args

### (Config File Migration Request)

**Prompt:** "okay this might be one the last ones, but can we move the config jsonc files into assets/config/? will need to update all the places these files are referenced.

oh, also, i'd like to change how these config files are referenced, so can you yank the ENV_VAR reference and instead setup a command argv flag for both the cli and server package? like `cli -c config.jsonc -s secrets.jsonc` but also be nice to also have the long flag form like `server --config config.jsonc`"

**Context:** User wanted to reorganize config files and replace environment variables with command line arguments.

### (Recovery Code Implementation Request)

**Prompt:** "hmm, yeah so i'm not quite sure i see the point of these federation_tokens? i see how they can keep consistant user id (and record) across instances, but this is basically the same as my current invite codes setup. like in the scenarios you explain, there's no way to ensure that the user didn't give the federation token to someone else, yeah?"

**Context:** User questioned federation approach and preferred a simpler recovery code system.

### (Account Recovery Context)

**Prompt:** "hmm, cool i appriciate the elaboration about the tradeoffs with these options. i guess can we step further back to look for other options here? so, at this point, i'm aiming for good security with admin-in-the-driver's-seat control. but what i'm working towards is a hosting a few of these servers (and browser clients) primarily for use on a lan (but again, i don't want to be lax with security) but there will be a wider audience perhaps thru tailscale or probably also just public internet hosting (like on a cloud server or whatever). i'd like to be sure to keep the private static files protected and the public files would just be public. so like i'd be accessing these static files over localhost and other hosts on my lan. but then i'd like to invite a few friends and family to be able to access (and perhaps even upload files at some point in the future). the passkey + invite code is pretty much ideal so far but i'm thinking about if one of my friends loose or somehow don't have their passkey setup on another of their devices; and in that case there's an easy way to still use their account. thoughts?"

**Context:** User explained their use case for a personal file hosting system and asked about account recovery options.

### (Config Organization Request)

**Prompt:** "can i move config.schema.json into the .zed/ folder? is that the only place it's referenced? do these editor dot folders not like other json files in them?"

**Context:** User wanted to clean up root directory by moving schema file to editor config folder.

### (CSS Redesign Request)

**Prompt:** "yeah, wonderful, ty. okay, so. the ui. first can we do some bigger remodeling here? can you take all the existing css and trash it? it's cute, but i really just want something super minimal (like really the least amount of css possible) that's just dark them so flat `black` on `white` with `magenta` color accents on link hover and visited. and then a big font ramp with a base font size of 16px, and h1 -> h6 is 3em (or do i want rem?). maybe a few other nice and elegant touches like some padding or magins but i want to keep it really simple."

**Context:** User wanted a complete UI redesign with minimal dark theme.

### (Server Argument Enhancement Request)

**Prompt:** "hmm, yeah so i'm not quite sure i see the point of these federation_tokens? i see how they can keep consistant user id (and record) across instances, but this is basically the same as my current invite codes setup."

**Context:** User wanted additional command line arguments for server host and port.

### (Host/Port Arguments Request)

**Prompt:** "right quick before we move to the registration web ui stuff, can you write about this in one of the md doc files?"

**Context:** User asked for documentation of the new features before moving to UI work.

### (Dynamic UI Request)

**Prompt:** "can we make the inputs and buttons more dynamic? can we use the same form field for both register and recovery tokens? like i guess i want the form to only show what's needed, so if there's an invite token value in the field, can show the register button, but not the login or logout. and if not invite token value then don't show register button. and i suppose there could be just either a login or logout button?"

**Context:** User wanted intelligent form that shows relevant buttons based on input state.

### (Dead Code Cleanup Request)

**Prompt:** "okay amazing, ty. i feel like we might need to revist all these `#[allow(dead_code)]` lines that got added 😬"

**Context:** User wanted to clean up unnecessary dead code attributes.

### (CSS Enhancement Request)

**Prompt:** "bet! okay! yr so amazing! i know i said for minimal ui, but can we do just a couple more things: can the buttons be white background with magenta border (no border-radius), and also on hover get color: black? can the inputs also get a similar treatment? so focus gets magenta background color and black color, oh and a magenta border when not hover or focused? also can we make the browser focus ring magenta, too 🤠

oh oh and finally, setup a key event for "Enter" on the input fields that click or do whatever action the login or register buttons do?"

**Context:** User requested specific styling improvements and keyboard accessibility.

### (Placeholder Visibility Fix)

**Prompt:** "hmm, is there a way to make the font color of the placeholder text on the inputs pure `white` (it's now gray which is difficult to see)"

**Context:** User wanted better visibility for input placeholder text.

### (Authentication State Management)

**Prompt:** "okay! nice! now what about the logic to show the logout button? if showing the logout button we wouldn't need to show the login input fields 🤔"

**Context:** User wanted cleaner authentication state management in UI.

### (API Endpoint Issue)

**Prompt:** "tite! ...but this returns a 404? http://localhost:8080/api/auth/status

does this route actually exist? or is something else going on?"

**Context:** User discovered missing authentication status endpoint.

### (UI State Management Bug)

**Prompt:** "okay! i'm now seeing "You are logged in" in the ui, but not the logout button. also i only get that view when i refresh the page, can you also handle after successful register or login?"

**Context:** User found bugs in authentication state management.

### (Final UI Tweaks)

**Prompt:** "...okay amazing two last little things, after pressing logout can we have the text inputs and login/register buttons visible again?

also, can we change the button style so that the background is black (not white) when not hovering?"

**Context:** User requested final UI polish for logout flow and button styling.

### (Documentation Request)

**Prompt:** "oh right, before the thread locks up because too many tokens, can you dump all the prompts i've written here to a new section at the bottom of docs/prompts.md (follow the format of the other similar thread promps there!)"

**Context:** User wanted to preserve all prompts from this thread in the documentation.

# Thread: SQLx Account Link Code Implementation and Database Migration Issues

### (SQLx Query Issues)

**Prompt:** "picking back up in a new thread, we were working on the new user recovery token thing. but i think there's something wrong with sqlx::query! stuff? the url to pg isn't like i have in my config or my .env? like i'd have localhost or something, not like a socket address (which is what i'm seeing in the errors)"

**Context:** User was experiencing SQLx compile-time checking issues where the database URL seemed to be incorrect, showing socket addresses instead of expected localhost configuration.

### (Editor vs Runtime Connection Clarification)

**Prompt:** "okay, feel free to gather context here, but this has to do with sqlx::query! doing automagical stuff in my code editor not like, the db connection when i actually run the server or cli programs..."

**Context:** User clarified that the issue was with SQLx's compile-time checking in the code editor (like rust-analyzer), not with runtime database connections.

### (Migration Status Check)

**Prompt:** "okay! since the migration hasn't run, can we re-work it a bit? instead of "recovery" can this have the name "account-link"? so like account-link-code (and whatever variations needed, just no more recovery)"

**Context:** User wanted to rename the recovery code feature to use "account-link" terminology instead, since the migration hadn't been applied yet.

### (Testing Recovery Code Generation)

**Prompt:** "okay, yeah, working thru actually testing a recovery code, so running this: `cargo run --bin cli users generate-recovery edward` i'm getting this error: ❌ Failed to generate recovery code: error returned from database: column "code_type" of relation "invite_codes" does not exist CLI error: error returned from database: column "code_type" of relation "invite_codes" does not exist i think there's only a partial stub implementation of the recovery code stuff"

**Context:** User discovered that the database schema was missing the new columns needed for the recovery/account-link functionality when testing the CLI command.

### (API Integration Request)

**Prompt:** "right, yeah, we need to wire up the api auth/routes.rs, the assets/index.html (and auth.js) and maybe other files?"

**Context:** User wanted to implement the full account link flow, including backend API routes and frontend integration to complete the feature.

### (Success Confirmation)

**Prompt:** "amazing! i started the server in a different term window and everything is working it seems! ty ty ty. can you drop all the prompts i've written in this thread into new section at the BOTTOM of docs/promps.md?"

**Context:** User confirmed that the account link code implementation was working successfully and requested documentation of the thread's prompts.

# Thread: June 20, 2025 - Client Library Refactoring and Web Component Development

### (Initial Client Library Refactoring Request)

okay! let's work out a nodejs app now. i'd like to rework the code in codegen/ and generated/ folders. they eventually should get deleted but i want to keep a lot of their essence. what i'd like is a new root foler named `clientlib` that's a nodejs repo (so has a package.json tsconfig.json and all that jazz). the code here will no longer get generated like it is now, instead it will be just a regular nodejs typescript app setup so code editor interaction is better. i'd like to keep the tests, and all the zod and fetch wrappers. maybe the big constant that describes all the routes (kinda like openapi does) could be useful. (i might consider just have a static open api .json file but that's for another time).

let's leave the assets index.html and auth.js around for just a bit longer, but what is to use the lib code there. i'd like to setup a simple web component for the demo site, like something simple with solid-js and esbuild for the web-component (dunno if that's best inside the client lib dir, tho)

anyhow! there's a lot here. can you just take it and run with it as much as you can? i won't need as much interactive help with the js stuff so don't do a lot of incremental build checks and such. just try to pile as much together at once as you can :) yr doing so great!

### (ESM Module Format Clarification)

so, you're doing so great, but let me understand a bit more, are you trying to generate the dist files with tsc? that's probably fine. i really want to stick with esm here and not futz with commonjs or other module formats.

also, for the web component i'd like to just use esbuild, so do we need a build.js file? let's not get too hung up on the tsc output at this moment.

### (Import Syntax Improvement Request)

what's up with the syntax where you do inline import()? can we avoid doing import() (like as a lazy load fn call) and just do imports at the top of the file? e.g. this: `Promise<import('./api-spec.js').HealthResponse> ` i guess this is just a type? so can we do a import type? i think it would get compiled away with esbuild? 🤔

### (Testing Setup Request)

excellent, let's get the tests running now. i think we need some more node_modules

### (Jest to Vitest Migration Request)

...actually, let's not futz with jest. can we drop the jest dep and switch to vitest?

### (Documentation Request)

do i have enough tokenz left in this thread for you to write all the prompts i've written to the bottom of docs/promps.md?

### (Token Limit Workaround)

...guess not? can you try again? or somehow use fewer tokenz? 😅

### (Final Documentation Request)

nope, can you just print them out in the chat?

### (Format Clarification)

oops, please put them all in one block of text (and markdown format?)

# User Prompts from Vitest Setup Thread

## Initial Setup Request

ohey again, the other thread we were working in ran outta tokenz!

but we were getting the clientlib vitest setup ironed out (we just yanked jest dep). can we pick that back up?

## ESLint Configuration Issue

hmm, we might be going in circles here? please make sure we're using the very latest eslint package versions, the config file has changed recently. could it be that we don't need `@typescript-eslint/recommended` now?

## Testing Strategy Discussion

...right, let's take a moment to think about this. i think before (or i think in scripts/build_and_test.sh) there's like some clever thing that runs the cli and writes some invite codes to disk. i don't love that way... so i guess the tests need some kind of way to write some data to the db, maybe the cli can be setup in a way where it can specify the value of the invite and link codes? so that way the js tests can just shell exec the cli program with a known code and it gets setup in the db (which is hopefully soon gonna be wired up to the test db :))

## Integration Test Ready

okay, let's iron out the rest of the tests and get them passing. i've booted a localhost dev server we can use to iron the remaining failing tests. then we might want to make sure the build_and_test.sh script still works

## Final Request

oh my, hit the token limit again. so please can you now collect all the prompts i've written here in this thread and write them as a message here in the thread? in a single text block that's markdown formatted, please :)

# Thread: June 20, 2025 - Integration Tests and Static Invite Codes Setup

## Initial Continuation Request

ohey again, we've been getting the clientlib/ tests working. i think the unit tests are in good shape. we were in the midst of doing the integration.test.ts file. we just got setup with a way to generate static invite and link codes.

## Development Server Restart

oops, that one might have been on me. i needed to restart my dev server after the new code gen changes? maybe try again?

## Configuration Issue

oh, but the server i have booted i don't think is using config.test.jsonc 🤔

## Database Configuration Fix

thought you weren't 'spossed to see that file ;)

(just hastling you, carry on, yr doing great, please look at all the files in my project!)

## All Routes Test Request

did we knock the mud off the tyres of all-routes.test.ts?

## Build Script Testing

bet! okay, i stopped my dev server. can we make sure the scripts/build_and_test.sh still works? it should take care of booting a server with test config and then running these new vitests we just setup (it might still be setup for the old generated/ code?)

## Docker Configuration Issue

oh, the version thing from that docker-compose cmd? i just now fixed that.

## Docker Volume Cleanup

okay, so we need a different npm script that doesn't boot the tests in watch mode (i like having watch mode for me, but it's not great for robotz like yrself and ci and such)

## Docker Cleanup Complete

so i think we renamed some things, and the docker compose files have gotten out of sync with the docker images that are running on my machine. okay, so i just trashed those docker images and volumes, i think we're good to re-try the clean and rerun the script

## Rust Test Priority

hol up, can we fix the rust test first?

## Success Celebration

wowwww 👏 well done!

## Documentation Request

dump all the prompts i wrote in this thread to a new section at the bottom of docs/prompts.md please 😋

## Final Cleanup Request

oh right! let's trash the codegen/ and generated/ folders now 🗑️

oh, also add this one last prompt to docs/prompts.md plz

Prompt Questions Collection

## Initial Setup

- okay, we've made a lot of progress on the clientlib stuff 👏 what i'd like to do now is build the web-component and setup a new assets/index.html file with this web component that does auth stuff and uses the clientlib code! let's keep the current assets/index.html and auth.js file around, just move it into the assets/private dir for now. let it rip getting the web-component built and into a new index.html file

## File Organization Issue

- my dev server should be running now! but i think i steered you in the wrong direction with the two index.html files. i didn't want you to overwrite the private/index.html. is there any way you can revert that? what i actually wanted was to move the assets/index.html file to assets/private/auth.html (sorry!) and then in the new assets/index.html i'd like to think it'd be really simple html doc with a <script> tag and a <web-authn-auth /> web component?

## Missing UI Elements

- ...okay, so where's the login name and code input text fields? and the buttons? can we start with an assets/index.html page that's just the web component script tag and the <webauthn-auth> web component?

## File Serving Issue

- oh, i think we need to like, copy the dist stuff over into this dir so that it comes out the static file route, too.

## React Errors

- wait, how tf did React stuff get in here?! getting these errors in the browser when i load: [React errors] i don't want any react, solid-js can do all the web-component stuff, i don't want useEffect or useRef stuff, use the solid-js reactive stuff, please!

## Working Example Reference

- okay, here's some things from a working web-component i made recently with solid-js: [code example] and i actually use vite to build, so maybe we use that instead of esbuild (sorry! i should have probably knew not to suggest that!) for example: `"web-component:build": "vite build --config vite.wc.config.ts"` so here's the vite.wc.config.ts that has some template stuff to generate a whole .index file [config example] 🤗

## Style Tag Issue

- also i don't think you want a <style> tag in there?

## Success But New Errors

- zomg! amazing, i see text inputs and buttons appear! but there is this error in the browser: (index):146 Uncaught ReferenceError: login is not defined at HTMLButtonElement.onclick ((index):146:58)

## Persistent React Errors

- onoz! we're back to these errorz: [React errors again] 🥺

## Cache Investigation

- hmmmm, i'm still getting the same errors, i dunno about cache, like i got those errors, you did a bunch of edits, and i got the login form, just with a problem with a click handler, then back to the react errors, i think something else is going on? also fwiw: i started a new server on a different port 8081 and still get the react errors, so pretty sure this is not browser cache thing ;)

## Missing Counter Component

- not sure if i see the counter? but this is now in my browser console: (index):44 ✅ Simple test component loaded

## Console Output Updates

- [Various console outputs showing debugging progress]

## TypeScript Errors Discovery

- okay, so when i look at this file `clientlib/web-component/src/webauthn-component.tsx` in my editor, there's lots of errors. maybe that needs to be delt with?

## Final Request

- oop, outta tokenz. can you collect all the prompt questions i made in this thread and write them in a message? just a single text block. markdown format :)

- can you write a message that i can send back to you in a new thread so we can pick back up quickly?
